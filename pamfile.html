<h2>NAME</h2>
pamfile - describe a Netpbm (PAM or PNM) file

<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<b>pamfile</b>

[<b>-allimages</b>]
[<b>-comments</b>]
[<b>-count</b>]
[<b>-machine</b>]
[<b>-size</b>]

[<i>file</i> ...]

<p>Minimum unique abbreviations of options are acceptable.  You may use
double hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.  You may use
white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name
from its value.

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pamfile</b> reads one or more Netpbm files as input and writes
out short descriptions of the image type, size, etc.  This is partly
for use in shell scripts, so the format is not particularly pretty.

<p>By default, <b>pamfile</b> reads only the header of the input file.
If that file is a pipe, that might cause problems for the process that is
feeding the pipe.  In that case, see the <b>-allimages</b> option.

<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
(most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>), <b>pamfile</b> recognizes the following
command line options:

<dl compact>
<dt><b>-allimages</b>

<dd>This option causes <b>pamfile</b> to describe every image in each
input file.  Without this option, <b>pamfile</b> describes only the
first image in each input file.

<p>This option also causes <b>pamfile</b> to read all the images from 
the input stream, whereas without it, <b>pamfile</b> reads only the header
of the first one.  If the input stream is from a pipe, the process that is
feeding the pipe might require the entire stream to be consumed.  In
that case, use this option even if the stream contains only one image.

<p>This option has no effect if you also specify <b>-count</b>.

<p>Note that before July 2000, a file could not contain more than one
image and many programs ignore all but the first.

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 9.5 (July 2000).

<dt><b>-comments</b>

<dd>This option causes <b>pamfile</b> to include for each PAM image
a report of the comments from the header of the image.

<p>For a PBM, PGM, or PPM image, <b>pamfile</b> reports there are no
comments, even if there are.

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.35 (August 2006).

<dt><b>-count</b>

<dd>This option causes <b>pamfile</b> to display only a count of how many
images are in each input file.

<p>As with <b>-allimages</b>, this causes <b>pamfile</b> to read all the
images.

<p>You may specify at most one of <b>-count</b>, <b>-machine</b>,
and <b>-size</b>.

<p>This option was new with Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005).

<dt><b>-machine</b>

<dd>This makes the output more convenient for a machine to use, while
  less convenient for a human.  <b>pamfile</b> reports the same information
  as with no options.

  <p>The output is one line of ASCII text per image.  Each line consists of
     the file name, followed by a colon, followed by a space, then the
     following tokens with a space in between:

    <ol>
      <li>Format: &quot;PAM&quot;, &quot;PBM&quot;, &quot;PGM&quot;, or
        &quot;PPM&quot;,
      <li>Subformat: &quot;PLAIN&quot; or &quot;RAW&quot;
      <li>Width: in pixels, in decimal
      <li>Height: in pixels, in decimal
      <li>Depth: in decimal
      <li>Maxval: in decimal (1 if image is PBM)
      <li>Tuple type (emulated if the image is not PAM)
    </ol>

<p>You may specify at most one of <b>-count</b>, <b>-machine</b>,
and <b>-size</b>.

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.86 (March 2019).

<dt><b>-size</b>

<dd>This makes the output contain only the height and width of the image,
in a form convenient for machine processing.

<p>There is one line of output per image, consisting of two blank-delimited
tokens:

<ol>
  <li>Width: in pixels, in decimal
  <li>Height: in pixels, in decimal
  </ol>
    
<p>Note that there is no way to tell which image is in which file, if you have
multiple input files with multiple images.  If that is your case,
use <b>-machine</b> instead.
  
<p>You may specify at most one of <b>-count</b>, <b>-machine</b>, and
<b>-size</b>.

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.86 (March 2019).
