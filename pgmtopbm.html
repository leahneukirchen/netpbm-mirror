<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p>This program is obsolete since Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).  Use <a
href="pamditherbw.html"><b>pamditherbw</b></a> to do what this program
used to do.

<p><b>pgmtopbm</b> never was the simple converter it appeared to be.
It was a dithering program.  Unfortunately, it didn't do the dithering
properly because it treated the PGM input samples as if they were
directly proportional to light intensity, but they are actually
gamma-adjusted.

<p><b>pamditherbw</b> is backward compatible with <b>pgmtopbm</b>
except that it 
<ul>
<li>does the correct gamma adjustments.
<li>produces PAM output instead of PBM.  (Modern Netpbm programs that
accept PBM input also accept PAM input, but if you need actual PBM,
you can use <b>pamtopbm</b> with <b>pamditherbw</b>).
</ul>
So use the manual for <b>pamditherbw</b> for <b>pgmtopbm</b>, except
ignore anything that says it was added after Netpbm Release 10.23
and ignore any options that are not shown in the synopsis above.
