<h2>NAME</h2>
pbmpage - create a one page test pattern for printing

<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<b>pbmpage</b>
[<b>-a4</b>]
<i>test_pattern</i>

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pbmpage</b> generates a one page test pattern to print on a
sheet of paper, for use in calibrating a printer.  The test pattern in
is PBM format.

<p><b>pbmpage</b> produces an image intended for 600 dots per inch
printer resolution.

<p>If you are printing on an HP PPA printer, you can convert the
output of this program to a stream that you can feed to the printer
with <b>pbmtoppa</b>.

<p>
Bear in mind that when you print the test pattern, you are testing not
only the printer, but any converter or driver software along the
printing path.  Any one of these components may adjust margins, crop
the image, erase edges, and such.

<p>If, because of addition of margins, the printer refuses to print the
image because it is too big, use <b>pamcut</b> to cut the right and
bottom edges off the test pattern until it is small enough to print.

<p><i>test_pattern </i> is the number of the test pattern to generate,
as follows.  The default is <b>1</b>.

<dl compact>
<dt><b>1</b>

<dd>
A black on white grid ruled in numbers of pixels.  A black one pixel box
is at the very edges of the paper.     

<p>Before Netpbm 10.18 (August 2003), the perimeter box was not there.

<dt><b>2</b>

<dd>
A vertical line segment, one pixel wide, extending 1/2" up from the
exact center of the page.
<dt><b>3</b>

<dd>
Two diagonal line segments, one starting at the upper left corner of the
page, the other starting from the lower right corner of the page.  Both
extend 1/2" toward the center of the page at 45 degrees.
</dl>

<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
(most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>), <b>pbmpage</b> recognizes the following
command line option:

<dl compact>
<dt><b>-a4</b>

<dd>Generate an image for A4 (European) paper.  Without this option,
<b>pbmpage</b> generates an image for US standard paper (8 1/2"
wide x 11" high).
