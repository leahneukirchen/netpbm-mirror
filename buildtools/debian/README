Files in this directory are for creating a Debian package (.deb file),
which one can use to install Netpbm on a Debian system (or a system running
a derivative of Debian, such as Ubuntu or Mint).

You can of course install on one of these systems by running 'installnetpbm',
or otherwise inserting all the files in the proper place in your system file
tree, but having a Debian package allows you to manage those files using
Debian's normal package management.  The package management system will know
where the Netpbm files came from, and you can upgrade or remove Netpbm easily.
The package management system will also be aware of prerequisites of Netpbm
and ensure that you don't have Debian's own inferior version of Netpbm
installed (which would cause conflicts).

The package we create is named 'netpbm-sf' (where the "sf" is from
"SourceForge"), to be distinct from the package named "netpbm" which is part
of Debian.

To install Netpbm as a Debian package:

  1) Follow the regular instructions to build and package Netpbm
     (configure, make, make package).

  2) With the root of the built Netpbm build tree as your current
     directory:

     $ make deb

     (This defaults to getting Netpbm from /tmp/netpbm, which is also where
     'make package' defaults to putting it).

  3) $ dpkg --install netpbm-sfXXXX.deb

     (netpbm-sfXXXX.deb is the file created by 'makedeb', in the current
     directory).


PREREQUSISITES
--------------

The following Debian packages are the known prerequisites for Netpbm
(and the package created by 'mkdeb' knows this).

    libc6
    libjpeg62
    libpng12-0
    libtiff4
    zlib1g
    ghostscript
    perl
    perl-base
    bash

Note that many of these are needed only for a few parts of Netpbm, and it will
be pretty obvious what the problem is when you need the prerequisite package
and don't have it, so if you don't want to install a prerequisite, it would
probably be fine to force install Netpbm, ignoring the prerequisites.


CONFLICTS WITH DEBIAN'S NETPBM
------------------------------

Debian has several packages of Netpbm, all based on a slightly modified
Sourceforge Netpbm 9.25 from 2002 (don't be confused by Debian's numbering
system, which makes it look like it is Netpbm 10).  If you want to install
Sourceforge Netpbm on your system, you will want first to remove any of these
you have installed:

  netpbm
  netpbm-dev
  libnetpbm9
  libnetpbm10

Sourceforge Netpbm should be backward compatible with all of those.  Note that
'mkdeb' makes only one package.  It contains the programs, the runtime
libraries, and the development files.

We have not yet worked out what has to be done about the fact that the Debian
packaging system thinks the Debian Netpbm packages are prerequisites for
things.  If you install Sourceforge Netpbm via the package created by mkdeb,
you should tell the Netpbm maintainer whatever you learn about that.
