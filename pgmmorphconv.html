double hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.  You may use
white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name
from its value.

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pgmmorphconv</b> performs morphological convolutions on a
PGM image: dilation and erosion.

<p><b>pgmmorphconv</b> performs a "topological" convolution.  For each
pixel of the input, <b>pgmmorphconv</b> generates an output pixel in
the same position.  To determine the intensity of the output pixel,
<b>pgmmorphconv</b> lays the template image over the input image such
that the middle pixel of the template is over the input pixel in
question.  <b>pgmmorphconv</b> looks at the input pixels underneath each
white pixel in the template.  For a dilation, the maximum intensity of
all those pixels is the intensity of the output pixel.  For an erosion,
it is the minimum.

<p>Thus, the dilation effect is that bright areas of the input get bigger
and dark areas smaller.  The erosion effect is the opposite.  The simplest
template image would be one with a white pixel in the middle and the rest
black.  This would produce an output image identical to the input.  Another
simple template image is a fully white square.  This causes bright or dark
areas to expand in all directions.  A template image that is white on the
left side and black on the right would smear the image to the right.

<p>The template file named by <i>templatefile</i> contains the
template image as a PBM image.  It must have an odd number of rows and
an odd number of columns, so there is a definite middle pixel.  It
must contain at least one white pixel.

<p>This is similar to the continuous convolution done by
<b>pnmconvol</b>, except that with <b>pnmconvol</b> the output intensity is
a weighted average of nearby input pixels instead of a minimum or maximum.

<p>This convolution changes the three Minkowski integrals in a predefined
way, and can be used to filter an image to enhance certain features, to
ease their automatic recognition.

<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
(most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>), <b>pgmmorphconv</b> recognizes the following
command line options:

<p>The options <b>-erode</b> and <b>-dilate</b> obviously produce an
erosion or dilation, respectively.  <p>The <b>-open</b> option causes
<b>pgmmorphconv</b> to perform first an erode and then a dilate
operation.  The <b>-close</b> option causes a dilate first and then an
erode.  If you specify none of these options, it is the same as
<b>-dilate</b>.

<p>With <b>-gradient</b>, <b>pgmmorphconv</b> produces an image which is the
difference between the eroded image and the dilated image.  <b>-gradient</b>
was new in Netpbm 10.70 (March 2015).
