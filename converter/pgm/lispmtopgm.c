**   When one writes a multi-plane bitmap with tv:write-bit-array-file, it is
**   usually a color image; but a color map is not written in the file, so we
**   treat this as a graymap instead.  Since the pgm reader can also read pbms,
**   this doesn't matter if you're using only single plane images.

           not always.  For the Lispm code to not round up, the array size
           must be the same size as the portion being written - that is, the
           array itself must be an odd size, not just the selected portion.
           Since arrays that are odd sizes can't be handed to bitblt, such
           arrays are probably not image data - so punt on it for now.

           Also, the lispm code for saving bitmaps has a bug, in that if you
           are writing a bitmap which is not mod32 across, the file may be up
           to 7 bits too short!  They round down instead of up.

            The code in 'pgmtolispm.c' always rounds up to mod32, which is
            totally reasonable.
