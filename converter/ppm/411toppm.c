/*
   I recently had a visit from my mom who owns a Sony Mavica camera.
   This camera produces standard MPEG and JPEG files, but it also
   creates 64x48 pixel thumbnails for preview/index on its own tiny
   LCD screen.  These files are named with an extension that is
   ".411".

   Sony appears not to want to document the ".411" file format, but it
   is clear from various web pages that it is a variant of the
   CCIR.601 standard YUV encoding used in MPEG.  The name indicates
   that the file content consists of chunks of 6 bytes: 4 bytes of
   image Y values, followed by 1 bytes of U and one byte of V values
   that apply to the previous 4 Y pixel values.

   There appear to be some commercial 411 file readers on the net, and
   there is the Java-based Javica program, but I prefer Open Source
   command-line utilities.  So, I grabbed a copy of netpbm-9.11 from
   SourceForge and hacked the eyuvtoppm.c file so that it looks like
   this.  While this may not be exactly the right thing to do, it
   produces results which are close enough for me.

   There are all sorts of user-interface gotchas possible in here that
   I'm not going to bother changing -- especially not without actual
   documentation from Sony about what they intend to do with ".411"
   files in the future.  I place my modifications into the public
   domain, but I ask that my name & e-mail be mentioned in the
   commentary of any derived version.

   Bryan Henderson reworked the program to use the Netpbm libraries to
   create the PPM output and follow some other Netpbm conventions.
   2001-03-03.  Bryan's contribution is public domain.
