   consider corners.  Then go through that list, producing the
   curve_list.  This is dictated by the fact that 'pixelList' does not
   necessarily start on a corner---it just starts at the character's
   first outline pixel, going left-to-right, top-to-bottom.  But we
   want all our splines to start and end on real corners.

   For example, consider the top of a capital `C' (this is in cmss20):

   this pixel a corner, we would wind up matching a very small segment
   from there to the end of the line, probably as a straight line, which
   is certainly not what we want.

   'pixelList' has one element for each closed outline on the character.
   To preserve this information, we return an array of curve_lists, one
   element (which in turn consists of several curves, one between each
   pair of corners) for each element in 'pixelList'.

   The curves we return do not have beginning and ending slope
