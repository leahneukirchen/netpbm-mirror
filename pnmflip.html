<BR>
<p><b>pnmflip</b> was replaced in Netpbm 10.13 (December 2002) by
<b><a href="pamflip.html">pamflip</a></b>.

<P><B>pamflip</b> is mostly backward compatible with <b>pnmflip</b>,
but works on PAM images too.

<P>One way <b>pamflip</b> is not backward compatible with <b>pnmflip</b>
is that <b>pnmflip</b> lets you specify any number of basic flip options,
whereas <b>pamflip</b> requires exactly one.  (<b>pamflip</b> provides
the <b>-xform</b> option for requesting multiple transformations, though).
Because of this incompatibility, <b>pnmflip</b> still exists as a
separate program, and all it does is translate its options to <b>pamflip</b>
style and run <b>pamflip</b>.

<P>You should not make any new use of <b>pnmflip</b> and if you modify an
existing use, you should upgrade to <b>pamflip</b>.
