<h2>NAME</h2>

ppmtoicr - convert a PPM image into NCSA ICR format 

<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<b>ppmtoicr</b>

[<b>-windowname</b> <i>name</i>]

[<b>-expand</b> <i>expand</i>]

[<b>-display</b> <i>display</i>]

[<i>ppmfile</i>]

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.  You may use white
space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name from its value.


<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>ppmtoicr</b> reads a PPM file as input.  Produces an NCSA Telnet
Interactive Color Raster graphic file as output.

If <i>ppmfile</i> is not supplied, <b>ppmtoicr</b> reads from Standard
Input.

<p>Interactive Color Raster (ICR) is a protocol for displaying raster
graphics on workstation screens. The protocol is implemented in NCSA
Telnet for the Macintosh version 2.3.  The ICR protocol shares
characteristics of the Tektronix graphics terminal emulation protocol.
For example, escape sequences are used to control the display.

<p><b>ppmtoicr</b> will output the appropriate sequences to create a
window of the dimensions of the input image, create a colormap of up
to 256 colors on the display, then load the picture data into the
window.

<p>Note that there is no icrtoppm tool - this transformation is one
way.

<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
(most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>), <b>ppmtoicr</b> recognizes the following
command line options:

<dl compact>
<dt><b>-windowname</b> <i>name</i>

<dd>Output will be displayed in <i>name</i>.

<p><i>name</i> must be printable characters, and not &quot;^&quot;.

<p>Default is to use the input file name if specified on the command line or
  "untitled" if the input is from Standard Input.  In the former case, any
  unprintable character or &quot;^&quot; in the file name becomes a
  &quot;.&quot; in the window name.
    
<dt><b>-expand</b> <i>expand</i>

<dd>Output will be expanded on display by factor <i>expand</i> (For
example, a value of 2 will cause four pixels to be displayed for every
input pixel.)

<dt><b>-display</b> <i>display</i>

<dd>Output will be displayed on screen numbered <i>display</i>

</dl>

<h2 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h2>

To display a PPM file named <b>ppmfile</b> using the protocol:

<pre>
    ppmtoicr ppmfile
</pre>

This will create a window named <i>ppmfile</i> on the display with the
correct dimensions for <i>ppmfile</i>, create and download a colormap
of up to 256 colors, and download the picture into the window.  You
may achieve the same effect with the following sequence:

<pre>
    ppmtoicr ppmfile &gt; filename
    cat filename
</pre>

<p>To display a GIF file using the protocol in a window titled after the
input file, zoom the displayed image by a factor of 2:

<pre>
    giftopnm giffile | ppmtoicr -windowname=giffile -expand=2
</pre>

<h2 id="limitations">LIMITATIONS</h2>

<p>The protocol uses frequent fflush() calls to speed up display.  If
you save the output to a file for later display via <b>cat</b>,
<b>ppmtoicr</b> will draw much more slowly.  In either case,
increasing the blocksize limit on the display will speed up
transmission substantially.

<h2 id="history">HISTORY</h2>

<p>Until Netpbm 10.71 (June 2015), there was a <b>-rle</b> option documented,
which was said to cause the output to use run length encoding compression.
But because of a simple bug in option processing code, the option never had
any effect.  And the compression code did not look like it worked anyway and
would take a fair amount of work to fix.  Because it was unlikely anyone would
ever use this program again, much less want to use run length encoding, we
removed it from the documentation rather than fix the code.
