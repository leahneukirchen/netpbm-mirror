<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>ppmtomitsu</b> reads a PPM image as input and converts it into a
format suitable to be printed by a Mitsubishi S340-10 printer, or any
other Mitsubishi color sublimation printer.

<p>The Mitsubishi S340-10 Color Sublimation printer can print in 24 bit color.
Images of the available sizes take so long to transfer that there is a fast
method, employing a lookup table, that <b>ppmtomitsu</b> uses if there are no
more than 256 colors in the image.  <b>ppmtomitsu</b> tries to position your
image at the center of the paper, and will rotate your image for you if
xs<i>ize</i> is larger than y<i>size</i>.  If your image is larger than the
media allows, <b>ppmtomitsu</b> fails. (We decided that the media were too
expensive to have careless users produce misprints).  Once data transmission
has started, the job can't be stopped in a sane way without resetting the
printer.  The printer understands putting together images in the
printer&apos;s memory; <b>ppmtomitsu</b> doesn't use this function because
<b>pamcat</b> etc provide the same functions and let you view the result
on-screen, too.  The S340-10 is the lowest common denominator printer; for
higher resolution printers there is the dpi300 option. The other printers are
also capable of higher values for <i>enlarge</i>, etc., but I don't think that
is valuable enough to warrant a change in the program.

<p>For proper results, the input maxval must be 255.  Use <b>pamdepth</b>
to ensure that it is.

<p>Before Netpbm 10.40 (September 2007), all Netpbm PPM programs, including
<b>ppmtomitsu</b>, see a PBM image as having maxval 1, so <b>ppmtomitsu</b>
does not function properly with PBM input.  You can use <b>ppmtoppm</b>
together with <b>pamdepth</b> to turn your PBM input into maxval 255
PPM input that <b>ppmtomitsu</b> will use properly.

<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
(most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>), <b>ppmtomitsu</b> recognizes the following
command line options:

<dl compact>
<dt><b>-sharpness</b> <i>1-4</i>

<dd>
"sharpness" designation.  Default is  to use the current sharpness.

<dt><b>-enlarge</b> <i>1-3</i>

<dd>
Enlarge by a factor; Default is 1 (no enlarge)

<dt><b>-media</b> {<b>A</b>|<b>A4</b>|<b>AS</b>|<b>A4S</b>}

<dd>
Designate the media you're using.  Default is 1184 x 1350, which will
fit on any media.  A is 1216 x 1350, A4 is 1184 x 1452, AS is 1216 x
1650 and A4S is 1184 x 1754.  A warning: If you specify a different
media than the printer currently has, the printer will wait until you
put in the correct media or switch it off.

<dt><b>-copy</b> <i>1-9</i>

<dd>
The number of copies to produce.  Default is 1.

<dt><b>-dpi300</b>

<dd>
Double the number of allowed pixels for a S3600-30 Printer in S340-10
compatibility mode.  (The S3600-30 has 300 dpi).

<dt><b>-tiny</b>

<dd>
Memory-saving, but always slow. The printer will get the data
line-by-line in 24bit. It's probably a good idea to use this if your
machine starts paging a lot without this option.
