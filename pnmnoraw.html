<h2>NAME</h2>

pnmnoraw - replaced by pnmtoplainpnm and pamtopnm

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pnmnoraw</b> was replaced in Netpbm 8.2 (March 2000) by <b><a
href="pnmtoplainpnm.html">pnmtoplainpnm</a></b>, which was obsoleted by
<b>pnmtopnm</b> in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004), which in turn was
obsoleted by <b>pamtopnm</b>.

<p><b>pnmtoplainpnm</b> was actually the same program; it was just renamed
to make it clear that is just a format converter.

<p><b>pamtopnm</b> is more general, in that it can go both directions.
<b>pamtopnm -plain</b> is the same as <b>pnmnoraw</b>.
