<h2>NAME</h2>
pamtosrf - convert a sequence of Netpbm images to a SRF image file


<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<p><b>pamtosrf</b>
[<b>-verbose</b>]
[<i>netpbmfile</i>]


<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pamtosrf</b> reads a Netpbm image stream as input and produces a
an SRF image file as output.  I don't know exactly what SRF is, but on popular
use of it is in Garmin vehicle information files, which tell a GPS receiver
how to depict a vehicle on its display.

<p>An SRF file can contain multiple images; each image in a multi-image
Netpbm input stream becomes one image in the SRF.

<p><b>pamtosrf</b> does not care how many images there are or what their
dimensions or content are.  However, a Garmin vehicle information file has
specific requirements, so if you don't make your Netpbm input conform, neither
will your SRF output.  For such a file, you should have two image: the first
for 3D oblique views of the vehicle and the second for overhead views.  Each
image is a horizontal concatenation of 36 square images, each rotated 10
degrees from the previous, thereby covering the full 360 degree circle.
You could create this concatenation with <b>pamcat -lr</b> and you could
create the invidual views with <b>pnmrotate</b>.


<p>One way to use <b>pamtosrf</b> is to get an SRF file, convert it to PAM
with <b>srftopam</b>, manipulate it, then convert it back with
<b>pamtosrf</b>.

<p><i>netpbmfile</i> is the input stream, which defaults to Standard Input.
Output is always on Standard Output.
