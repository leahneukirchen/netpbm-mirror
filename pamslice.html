<h2>NAME</h2>
pamslice - extract one line of values out of a Netpbm image

<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<b>pamslice</b>
{<b>-row=</b><i>rownumber</i> | <b>-column=</b><i>columnnumber</i>}
[<b>-plane=</b><i>planenumber</i>]
[<i>imagefile</i>]

<?makeman .SH OPTION USAGE ?>
<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
You may use two hyphens instead of one.  You may separate an option
name and its value with white space instead of an equals sign.

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pamslice</b> extracts one line of tuples (pixels) out of a
Netpbm image and prints their values in a table.  A line means a row
or column.  It shows you a one-dimensional cross section of a
two-dimensional image.  (With the <b>-plane</b> option, it can be
thought of as a one-dimensional cross-section of a three-dimensional
image).

<p>The table has one line per tuple, consisting of blank-separated
ASCII decimal numbers.  The first number is the column number if you
specified a row slice or the row number if you specified a column
slice.  The rest of the numbers are the sample values in plane number
order.  For a PBM or PGM input, there is only one plane.  For a PPM
input, Plane 0 is red, Plane 1 is green, and Plane 2 is blue.  See the
specifications of the image formats for details on exactly what these
numbers mean.

<p>If you want to see the entire raster of a Netpbm image, use
<b>pamtable</b>.

<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
(most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>), <b>pamslice</b> recognizes the following
command line options:

<dl compact>
<dt><b>-row=</b><i>rownumber</i>
<dd>
     This indicates that the slice is to be horizontal -- i.e. one row of the
     image -- and indicates which row.  Rows are numbered from the top
     starting with 0.

     <p>You cannot specify both <b>-row</b> and <b>-column</b>.

<dt><b>-column=</b><i>colnumber</i>
<dd>
     This indicates that the slice is to be vertical -- i.e. one column of the
     image -- and indicates which column.  Columns are numbered from the left
     starting with 0.

     <p>You cannot specify both <b>-row</b> and <b>-column</b>.

<dt><b>-plane=</b><i>planenumber</i>
<dd>
     This specifies that you are interested in only one plane of the image
     and which one.  Planes are numbered from 0 and have meanings that vary
     on the type of image.  In a PPM image, Plane 0 is red, Plane 1 is
     green, and Plane 2 is blue.

     <p>If you don't specify <b>-plane</b>, you get all the planes -- each
     line of output has multiple numbers in addition to the sequence number.
     If you do specify <b>-plane</b>, each line of output contains one
     number in addition to the sequence number.

<dt><b>-xmgr</b>
<dd>
     This option causes <b>pamslice</b> to format the output as input for a
     <b>xmgr</b> so you can plot it.  The only difference this option makes
     is that it adds header information to the beginning of the output.

<h2 id="history">HISTORY</h2>

<p><b>pamslice</b> replaced <b>pgmslice</b> in Netpbm 10.3 (June 2002).
It was backward compatible, but worked on Netpbm images other than PGM and
PBM and added the <b>-plane</b> and <b>-xmgr</b> options.

<b>pgmslice</b> after being unable to find the source code to Marco
Beijersbergen's program with the same name.  Bryan Henderson converted it
to <b>pamslice</b>.
