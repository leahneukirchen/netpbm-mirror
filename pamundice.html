<p>You can use the minimum unique abbreviation of the options.  You can use
two hyphens instead of one.  You can separate an option name from its value
with white space instead of an equals sign.

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program is part of <a href="index.html">Netpbm</a>.

<p><b>pamundice</b> reads a bunch of Netpbm images as input and combines them
as a grid of tiles into a single output image of the same kind on Standard
Output.

<p>You can optionally make the pieces overlap.

<p>The images can either be in files whose names indicate where they go in the
  output (e.g. &quot;myimage_part_03_04&quot; could be the image for Row 3,
  Column 4 - see the <i>input_filename_pattern</i> argument) or listed in a
  file, with a <b>-listfile</b> option.

<p>The input images must all have the same format (PAM, PPM, etc.)
and maxval and for PAM must have the same depth and tuple type.
All the images in a rank (horizontal row of tiles) must have the
same height.  All the images in a file (vertical column of tiles)
must have the same width.  But it is not required that every rank
have the same height or every file have the same width.

<p><b>pamdice</b> is the inverse of <b>pamundice</b>.  You can use
<b>pamundice</b> to reassemble an image sliced up by <b>pamdice</b>.
You can use <b>pamdice</b> to recreate the tiles of an image created
by <b>pamundice</b>, but to do this, the original ranks must all have
been the same height except for the bottom one and the original files
must all have been the same width except the right one.

<p>One use for this is to process an image in pieces when the whole image is
too large to process.  For example, you might have an image so large that an
image editor can't read it all into memory or processes it very slowly.  You
can split it into smaller pieces with <b>pamdice</b>, edit one at a time, and
then reassemble them with <b>pamundice</b>.

<p>Of course, you can also use <b>pamundice</b> to compose various kinds of
checkerboard images, for example, you could write a program to render a
chessboard by computing an image of each square, then using <b>pamundice</b>
to assemble them into a board.
  
<p>An alternative to join images in a single direction (i.e. a single
rank or a single file) is <b>pamcat</b>.  <b>pamcat</b> gives you more
flexibility than <b>pamundice</b> in identifying the input images: you
can supply them on Standard Input or as a list of arbitrarily named
files.

<p>To join piecewise photographs, use <b>pnmstitch</b> instead of
<b>pamundice</b>, because it figures out where the pieces overlap,
even if they don't overlap exactly vertically or horizontally.

<p>To create an image of the same tile repeated in a grid, that's
<b>pnmtile</b>.

<p><b>pnmindex</b> does a similar thing to <b>pamundice</b>: it
combines a bunch of small images in a grid into a big one.  But its
purpose is to produce a an index image of the input images.  So it
leaves space between them and has labels for them, for example.


<h2 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h2>

<p>Unless you use a <b>-listfile</b> option,, there is one non-option
argument, and it is mandatory: <i>input_filename_pattern</i>.  This
tells <b>pamundice</b> what files contain the input tiles.

<p><b>pamundice</b> reads the input images from files which are named
with a pattern that indicates their positions in the combined image.
For example, <b>tile_00_05.ppm</b> could be the 6th tile over in the
1st rank, while <b>tile_04_01</b> is the 2nd tile over in the 5th rank.

<p>You cannot supply any of the data on Standard Input, and the files
must be the kind that <b>pamundice</b> can close and reopen and read
the same image a second time (e.g. a regular file is fine; a named
pipe is probably not).

<p><i>input_filename_pattern</i> is a printf-style pattern.  (See the
standard C library <b>printf</b> subroutine).  For the example above,
it would be <b>tile_%2d_%2a.ppm</b>.  The only possible conversion
specifiers are:

<dl>

<dt><b>d</b>
<dd>"down": The rank (row) number, starting with 0.

<dt><b>a</b>
<dd>"across": The file (column) number, starting with 0.

<dt><b>%</b>
<dd>The per cent character (%).

</dl>

<p>The number between the % and the conversion specifier is the
precision and is required.  It says how many characters of the file
name are described by that conversion.  The rank or file number is
filled with leading zeroes as necessary.

<p>So the example <b>tile_%2d_%2a.ppm</b> means to get the name of
the file that contains the tile at Rank 0, File 5, you:

<ul>

<li>replace the "%2d" with the rank number, as a 2 digit
decimal number: "00"

<li>Replace the "%2a" with the file number, as a 2 digit
decimal number: "05"
</ul>

<p>Note that this pattern describes file names that <b>pamdice</b>
produces, except that the precision may be more or less.
(<b>pamdice</b> uses however many digits are required for the highest
numbered image).


<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
(most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see <a href="index.html#commonoptions">
Common Options</a>), <b>pamundice</b> recognizes the following
command line options:

<dl compact>
<dt><b>-across=</b><i>N</i>

<dd>This is the number of tiles across in the grid, i.e. the number of
tiles in each rank, or the number of files.

<p>Default is 1.


<dt><b>-down=</b><i>N</i>

<dd>This is the number of tiles up and down in the grid, i.e. the
number of tiles in each file, or the number of ranks.

<p>Default is 1.

<dt><b>-hoverlap=</b><i>pixels</i>

<dd>This is the amount in pixels to overlap the tiles horizontally.
<b>pamundice</b> clips this much off the right edge of every tile
before joining it to the adjacent image to the right.  The tiles along
the right edge remain whole.

<p>There must not be any input image narrower than this.

<p>Note that this undoes the effect of the same <b>-hoverlap</b>
option of <b>pamdice</b>.

<p>Default is zero -- no overlap.

<dt><b>-voverlap=</b><i>pixels</i>

<dd>This is analogous to <b>-hoverlap</b>, but <b>pamundice</b>
clips the bottom edge of each image before joining it to the one below.

<dt><b>-listfile=</b><i>filename</i>
<dd>This option names a file that contains the names of all the input files.
This is an alternative to specifying a file name pattern as an argument.

<p>The named file contains file name, one per line.  Each file contains the
  image for one tile, in row-major order, top to bottom, left to right.  So
  the first file is the upper left tile, the second is the one to right of
  that, etc.  The number of lines in the file must be equal to the number of
  tiles in the output, the product of the <b>-across</b> and <b>-down</b>
  values.
  
<p>The file names have no meaning to <b>pamundice</b>.  You can use the same
  file multiple times to have identical tiles in the output.

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.90 (March 2020).

<dt><b>-verbose</b>

<dd>Print information about the processing to Standard Error.

</dl>

<h2 id="history">HISTORY</h2>

<p><b>pamundice</b> was new in Netpbm 10.39 (June 2007).  Before that,
<b>pamcat</b> is the best substitute.
